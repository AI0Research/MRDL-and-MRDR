The EU has regulations on imports that must be followed by all exporting nations.\n\nJust to give you an idea of what that looks like, we ship organic lettuce from the U.K. to spain (via Calais) during the summer months and this is what\u2019s needed:\n\n1. An ENS declaration needs to be made into French import control system. If you have a truck with 50 different commodities you need to supply each different tariff code, the invoice numbers, pieces, weight. And at the header level, truck reg, importer / exporter / driver name / driver nationality / port of exit / port of arrival. This could take 1-2 hours if you did have 50 separate commodities, or 10-15 minutes for a smaller shipment.\n\n2. Export customs declaration. This requires almost all of the information listed above plus more, like the value of the goods and any certificate declarations. Again, it can take anywhere from 10-15 minutes to 2 hours depending how many different commodities.\n\n3. Phytosanitary certificate. This is provided by DEFRA / plant health and is applied for by the supplier using a government system. Sometimes an actual inspection of the product is required. This can take up to 24 hours to get processed.  \n\n4. Certificate of conformity. This is a certificate that\u2019s applied for, for organic products using the soil associations system and can take up to an hour. \n\n5. T1 / TAD. This is a transit document that allows movement through one European country to be cleared in another. Because we ship product to Spain via France we need one of these. It\u2019s applied for using the U.K. governments NCTS system. Similar information is required to a customs entry and can take a couple of hours to be validated by NCTS.\n\n6. A CHED document is required in France and is created by a French agent using the European TRACES system. This contains information such as the Latin name of the produce, net weight and is linked to the phytosanitary certificate. This document is then validated in Calais by the French SIVEP agency and may require physical inspection.\n\n7. A soivre document is required in Spain to verify the produce is of a certain quality. The same information as provided in the customs declarations and the CHED declarations is required. Soivre might want to inspect the goods physically, it\u2019s luck of the draw.\n\n8. A Spanish import declaration is required and is submitted to Spanish customs (AEAT). This contains everything on the export customs declaration and more, and must be linked to the soivre in the declaration. It must also be carried out at a verified customs warehouse aka a LAME.\n\n9. The T1/TAD must be discharged at this customs warehouse or the U.K. shipper will be liable for a fine in the U.K. \n\nThis is all for just ONE consignment. A truck could have many consignments if it\u2019s groupage. All this listed above has to be done for each consignment on that truck. Now imagine trying to make this work *at scale*\n\nOnly after all that can the product be delivered to the customer. There are less protocols for non food products and the process between European countries varies slightly, but the crux of this is that there is no silver bullet to speed this up or streamline it. Actually there is a magic bullet, it\u2019s being inside the customs union. \n\nJust think, 2 years ago, any company in the U.K. shipping practically any product to the the EU could literally sling it on the back of a truck and that was that. \n\nSome might ask, well how does any other country ship to the EU, and the answer is because the infrastructure is already set up, it\u2019s the way they\u2019ve always done it. Container ports and airports are set up exactly for this kind of transaction. \n\nThe UK\u2019s geographical proximity and usage of trucks does not fit with this model. There\u2019s too little time and too much work. The \u201cjust in time\u201d logistics model is a square peg and these new requirements are a round hole. \n\nOur whole nation\u2019s export industry is based around easy access to the European market, it\u2019s been this way over 50 years.\n\nWe\u2019re heading for economic oblivion, and because most of our MP\u2019s are oblivious to the reality of these processes at an operational level, they are blindly leading the country to doom.

But, from the other side what do you do? Allow a pass for a while until standards change in some way, and hope things don't change too much while having no automatic right to inspect the facilities?

From the EU perspective, it's a simply change to apply the same rules, and it's less likely to have problems if standards have changed without notification.\n\n\"the U.K. is in a unique position due to the volume of trade, geographical proximity and complete upheaval of a standardised way of working that existed for half a century\"\n\nWhich basically became irrelevant the moment the UK decided to remove itself from the thing that manages it all, and the EU chose to value things like freedom of movement over trade volume when negotiating their position.

But, at the end of the day the EU's responsibility is to its own citizens, and the UK government has announced that they can't be trusted to keep their end of bargains.\n\nThat's really it. Nothing has changed from the EU's point of view, except one country has moved from \"EU\" to \"third country\" status on trade rules. It doesn't benefit them to add a new set of rules that sort of apply to the UK but needs to be constantly monitored and updated in case the UK changes its own policies in a way that negatively impacts them.\n\nIt has to be terrible for your day to day and it must seem like it's complete nonsense.

International ports have the infrastructure set up ie the border inspection posts and most of all the experience is there. \n\nThey\u2019ve been following the relevant processes since the beginning and mature processes exist around it.\n\nNow the difference with the U.K. is three things. \n\n1. We\u2019ve been thrust into a new world of being outside the customs union after spending 50 years doing things a certain way. This alone is a huge upheaval. Going from throwing something in the back of a truck to all the processes I\u2019ve listed is way more difficult than you might think. I\u2019ve had meetings with Porsche, Mazda, Tkmaxx and other huge names about brexit when it was first being discussed. These companies have thousands if not hundreds of thousands of skus. Most of which they don\u2019t even have classified with a tariff code. They admitted to us that most of the time, they treated their trucks like shuttles and had no idea what they were even putting on the back. Imagine going from that to having to be insanely prepared ahead of time with manifest, values, tariff codes etc. And the nature of trucking logistics is, these trucks aren\u2019t booked weeks in advance so you can prepare, they\u2019re booked the day before the stuff has to leave.\n\n2. Geographical proximity. The U.K. is a mere few hours away from the mainland. The whole logistics model that we operate is \u201cjust in time\u201d. trucks are booked the day before or same day. This puts huge amounts of pressure on people to have the correct documentation ready in time. Quite often we have to produce all that documentation in my other comment in a space or 3 hours. This is the way we trade with Europe. Now compare that to containers from Japan, you have 30-40 days to prepare everything you need. With air freight you are given 2-3 days at the destination airport without paying storage costs to give you time to prepare everything. And again as with the sea ports, all the infrastructure and knowledge exists there as it\u2019s always been done that way. \n\n3. Volume. We move so much to and from the EU. All on trucks. The scale is somewhat difficult to understand unless you see it first hand. The U.K. (used to) import and export a shit tonne to Europe.  \nAnd when you consider groupage loads are a huge part of that, it\u2019s extremely difficult to manage all the documentation for a truck that has 15 different consignments. If you compare that with LCL (groupage containers) from the far east, there are thousands and thousands of consolidators all set up and ready with processes who handle this shit every day. It\u2019s been their business for decades, they know exactly what they\u2019re doing. These do not exist at the same scale for U.K. - EU transit because they haven\u2019t been needed for 50 years.

The Lea Valley Growers Association (LVGA), seeded through an area running across Greater London, Essex and Hertfordshire, comprises more than 180 hectares (450 acres) of glasshouses, run by 80 growers. The valley should be a jewel in the crown for a country concerned with homegrown industry and food security.\n\nBut hit by Brexit, a flawed Home Office plan for workers, and now rising energy prices, more than a third of the growers have applied for planning permission to knock down 60 hectares of greenhouses to replace them with housing estates, warehouses and small factories. Their applications have been granted.\n\n\u201cWithout government assistance for British food producers, the largest hub in the UK\u2019s glasshouse sector could face extinction within the next two years,\u201d said Lee Stiles, the LVGA secretary, \u201cto be concreted over by houses and industry.\n\n\u201cThe association has 80 growers and 450 acres of glasshouses,\u201d he said. \u201cTwenty growers have permission for housing, representing 100 acres, and another 10 have permission to develop their 50 acres for light industrial uses.\u201d\n\nThe Lea Valley needs 2,200 workers a year, and the companies were hit hard by Brexit. The seasonal workers scheme set up by the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which was meant to ease the problems, requires workers to return home after six months.\n\n\u201cThis means that, in a season which runs for 10 or 11 months, growers have to recruit twice the amount, and train workers twice, to do the same job,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cOur growers experienced a 40% shortfall in workers this year. The government\u2019s six-month rule results in many growers finishing with a completely different workforce than they started with, with some unable to complete the season due to a lack of workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cForty of them, representing 200 acres, haven\u2019t planted this year,\u201d said Stiles. \u201cAnd another 10, who had 60 acres, have ceased trading.\u201d\n\nAmong them were four growers who previously cultivated one in every 20 lettuces eaten by British households. They have stopped growing them completely in the past two years, while others who grew 100m sweet peppers have this season been forced to cut their crop in half. Seventy-four-year-old Elvio Cipullo and his wife Luigia, aged 68, started their business growing salads leaves, cucumbers and herbs 52 years ago, and are now getting up at at 5.30am to try to make up for the shortfall in workers.\n\n\u201cThey will go down on their hands and knees to cut the parsley,\u201d says their son, 48-year-old Tony, who now runs the 11 acres of seven glasshouses. \u201cIt\u2019s dirty work. But they know they have to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of the lettuce growers are in the process of selling their nurseries,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cIt is pointless planting a crop if you are not confident of securing the labour to pick it as you will simply have it throw it all away.\u201d\n\nThey have also been harder hit than most industries by the huge rise in gas prices, because they have to heat greenhouses. \u201cThe largest input costs for growers used to be labour followed by energy,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cNow it is energy followed by labour. Half of growers did not plant when vital supplies of gas for greenhouses soared from 30p a therm in January and has now hit \u00a34 a therm.\n\n\u201cIn the 14 years I have been in this job, this is the worst I have ever seen. Ninety per cent of our members are family businesses, traditionally employing 2,500 people. We have only one large corporate.\u201d\n\nThe result of the government scheme, he said, was fewer British growers, lost jobs, more imported food, more food miles, an increased carbon footprint and greater climate damage. \u201cHorticultural growers in the EU receive state aid. We, of course, don\u2019t receive any EU money at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThe UK has been losing large slices of its salads and vegetables market to producers in Spain and Morocco who don\u2019t have to use gas to heat greenhouses, and who are just four days by road from here.\u201d\n\nGrowers received notification from George Eustice, the secretary of state at Defra, in late July that they must pay immigrant workers a minimum of \u00a310.10 an hour. \u201cGeorge Eustice had denied that the minimum wage would rise to \u00a310.10 at the National Farmers\u2019 Union conference in February,\u201d Stiles said, \u201cand then U-turned just weeks later.\n\n\u201cThat is higher than the national minimum wage, which the government is now enforcing under its seasonal workers scheme. But our growers also have to provide accommodation for them.\u201d\n\nThere could, however, be an even greater impact nationwide, said grower Tony Cipullo, who has four hectares of glasshouses in the Lea Valley.\n\nA card-carrying Tory party member, who voted in the leadership election, he warned the next occupant of No 10: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be about people having to pay more this winter for their fresh food. If many more growers are forced to stop producing it, they are going to starve.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Defra told the Guardian: \u201cWe are aware of the challenges facing farmers from increased input costs, particularly energy, as well as their concerns regarding seasonal workers\u2019 pay. That\u2019s why we have brought forward 50% of the BPS payment to help farmers right now, on top of fuel duty and VAT cuts, and freezing the business rates multiplier to reduce bills.\n\n\u201cWe have already boosted the number of visas available through the seasonal workers route to 40,000 and amended the pay requirements earlier this year, removing the minimum annual salary requirement to give more certainty over costs and ensure farmers can access the workforce they need.

Some agreement with Indiana, a state with a population slightly larger than that of Scotland, does indeed fall short of a full US-UK trade deal. No disagreement here.

Whether you voted to leave or to remain the decision has been made and it is crucial that the country seizes the reality of the situation and takes full advantage of the opportunities that not being part of the EU presents for Britain on the world stage.\n\nThis is essentially saying that the UK's current situation is a fait accompli and that people should just get over it. Why? If you thought Brexit was a bad idea and you see the consequences are dire, then why should you not try to mitigate said consequences by partially reverting Brexit? Why would anyone who thinks Brexit is harmful \"get over it\"? There is no rational reason to do so, especially as they are already a majority and growing. Only the UK's party political and electoral system robs them of the political power to do exactly what the author doesn't want them to do, so he has to pretend that what they want is impossible.\n\n> Viewed dispassionately, the opportunity exists to diverge from long-established EU rules and to introduce more business-friendly regulation that can encourage investment and job creation. Processes around the import and export of goods and services can also be streamlined as part of an overarching strategy to make the UK THE place to do business in the world.\n\nEmpty rhetoric. Policy decisions always come with a cost, and the cost of \"streamlining processes\" and \"business friendly regulation\" will be externalized to society as a whole. It's curious that the author doesn't name what he means by this: deregulation. One can only assume that he knows perfectly well that it would be incredibly unpopular with leavers and remainers alike, so he has to disguise his meaning.\n\n> In June, the International Trade Secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan spoke about leading a concerted push to remove up to 100 restrictions that had been identified as blocking British businesses from trading overseas, in a \u2018bonfire of the barriers\u2019.\n\nExcept that is not true. By removing regulations, you are increasing barriers with the huge market on your doorstep. By removing regulations, you are disadvantaging your own companies and increasing the systemic risks and social costs. The UK will lose far more close by than it will gain far off. You don't need to be an economist to see that this will result in a net loss. Which is another thing: if Brexit and deregulation is so great, why are UK companies and most economists not happy about it?\n\n> Freeports\n\nWhat are freeports in the context proposed here? Again, the author seeks to disguise his meaning with vague phrases. Freeports as he describes them are just another way to subsidize businesses at the expense of society. They pay less tax. They do not have to comply with society's rules. They are free from oversight. It has been noted multiple times that all they do is *move* business, not attract them. They are merely an opportunity for anti-social behaviour and criminality, as has been noted by many governments (including the EU commission). Again, these regulations were there for a reason, and it makes no sense to suspend them for some and leave them in place for others.\n\n> Asia-Pacific and CPTPP\n\nThe gravity model of trade predicts that the gains will be minimal compared to the losses sustained by moving away from the single market. The UK does not border the pacific ocean and the only reason this resonates is because A) the UK has burned its bridges with the EU while the USA isn't terribly interested and B) it brings back memories of empires and colonies.\n\n> The \u2018Partnership Council\u2019, was established to oversee UK-EU trade relations in the aftermath of Brexit. Unfortunately, it has not met since June 2021.\n\nBecause the UK is breaking both treaties that establish said council. The fact that the author is again vague about how to reinvigorate it speaks volumes. Everybody knows what needs to happen to do this: the UK needs to uphold its obligations. Nobody wants to strike deals with a cheat and a liar.\n\n> Dubai and the World Expo\n\nThis paragraph is just delusional. Economic success will not come through costly PR trips. It is the product of economic and social policy. The UK has long adhered to an economic policy that emphasizes London and its financial service industry at the expense of everything else. Hence the social and economic divisions in the UK.\n\n> The challenge now, as the autumn approaches and with a new Prime Minister in Downing Street, is to retain that can-do spirit and build on it with a clear plan. If delivered this would more than likely allow the wealth and job-creating community to flourish, and thereby help to underwrite further funding for our worthy public services.\n\n\"can do spirit\" in this context means \"lies\", which sort of invalidates the plan and puts a big question mark behind the \"if\" in the following sentence. What has this UK government delivered, actually? It has been almost entirely performative, even in seeking the elusive benefits of Brexit. It was primarily concerned with keeping its grip on power to the point where it constructed an alternative reality to avoid confronting the actual one. I think the only \"can do spirit\" that will materialize now is the conviction of people to get rid of these demagogues, now that the lies and the failures are becoming too obvious to deny. Even \"leave\" supporters may start to feel like this, as promises have not been kept. After all, revolutions tend to devour their own children, and even if they don't blame Brexit they will blame those who \"implemented it wrong\".\n\nOverall, the tone of the article is emotional, and the delivery is dishonest. It seeks to divert and disguise, presumably because the author knows that what he is saying is not true and what he proposes is not popular.

Deregulation, especially social and environmental deregulation, generates short term corporate profits for owners and shareholders. Financial deregulation benefits oligarchs and speculators both. Sure it will immediate harm most people and eventually destroy the social and economic system,  but then they don't value that or don't look that far ahead.\n\nIt's not as if people like these arrived at deregulation through Brexit. It's the other way round. Their job is to create rationalizations for and distractions around policies that will harm most (if not all) people, and that are consequently very unpopular. They know perfectly well what these policies will do, so they need to lie and stoke division to sell them. Hence their adoption of radical populist nationalism, even though the protectionist impulses of the latter are anathema to them.

While 26 per cent of jobs in London are connected in one way or another with the export of goods or services, this figure is significantly lower as you move away from the south-east, falling to 2.6 per cent for businesses in the North-East.\n\nJobs connected to exporting pay on average seven per cent more than non-exporting equivalents. Therefore, boosting the volume and value of goods and services sold overseas can play a pivotal role in truly helping to level up the economy of the UK, bringing new investment, new industries and good jobs to places like the West Midlands.\n\n## Is it time to get over Brexit?\n\nWe are now over six years on from the Brexit referendum. Whether you voted to leave or to remain the decision has been made and it is crucial that the country seizes the reality of the situation and takes full advantage of the opportunities that not being part of the EU presents for Britain on the world stage.\n\nViewed dispassionately, the opportunity exists to diverge from long-established EU rules and to introduce more business-friendly regulation that can encourage investment and job creation. Processes around the import and export of goods and services can also be streamlined as part of an overarching strategy to make the UK THE place to do business in the world.\n\nThere is no question that the referendum itself was divisive and challenges remain as we decouple from the EU. Nonetheless, potential opportunities from a trading perspective exist and are a gift that should not be squandered.\n\n## Bonfire of Barriers\n\nIn June, the International Trade Secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan spoke about leading a concerted push to remove up to 100 restrictions that had been identified as blocking British businesses from trading overseas, in a \u2018bonfire of the barriers\u2019.\n\nExamples such as removing delays in registering new UK medicines and medical devices in South Africa were given, although more details have been withheld due to understandable commercial sensitivities.\n\nIt is to be hoped that these initiatives are being followed through by our trade officials. With an estimated \u00a320 billion in export opportunities to be opened up with the removal of restrictions, this is a great example where effective delivery of a plan would provide significant benefits to job and wealth creation.\n\n## Freeports\n\nThe establishment of Freeports is another constructive move towards encouraging regions and businesses to develop international trading activities.\n\nThis is being well demonstrated on Teesside, the first of the eight Freeports announced in 2021, where the benefits offered by Freeport status, including a package of tax reliefs, simplified customs procedures and streamlined planning processes, have been seized upon.\n\nLast month the Korean business SeAH Wind started construction on a new \u00a3400m factory producing bases for offshore wind turbines on a 1.1 million square foot site within the Freeport. Ultimately the turbines will be transported directly from a new quay that is being built in the Freeport out to what will be the world\u2019s largest wind farm on Dogger Bank in the North Sea. The SeAH factory will create over 750 new jobs in the area, with many more coming indirectly in the supply chain. This will also help to establish Teeside as a world leader in the field of wind technology. In time the area should also see itself exporting skills and products around the world.\n\nOur businesses know this area well. By way of disclosure, in conjunction with a range of prominent partners, our family is currently developing the mixed-use Milburngate development in Durham, a new HQ for the Home Group in Newcastle and the \u00a3300m Sage Arena and conference centre on the banks of the Tyne.\n\nThere is a genuine sense of momentum in the air across the region, in which the Freeport plays a central role.\n\nFreeports also demonstrates how businesses will respond constructively to government policies which incentivise investment with easy-to-understand benefits and timeframes, just as it did with the 1980s version of Enterprise Zones.", "author": "trololo909"}, "imd0di7": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "Part 2 of 2\n\n## Asia-Pacific and CPTPP\nOur family office has long supported the UK\u2019s efforts to join the \u2018Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2019 (CPTPP).\n\nThis is a free trade agreement between 11 countries around the Pacific Rim, including Australia, Canada, Japan and Singapore, whose collective economies represent nearly 14 per cent of global GDP. By 2030 Asia will be home to 65 per cent of the world\u2019s 5.4 billion middle class consumers, and so joining the CPTPP and strengthening trading ties in the region as part of the UK\u2019s more general \u2018tilt\u2019 towards the Indo-Pacific shows commendable foresight.\n\nAccession to the CPTPP should be concluded by the end of the year and will be a material step forward to create conditions to encourage British exports.\n\nBritain also has Free Trade discussions underway with India, Israel and the six states that make up the Gulf Co-operation Council.\n\nHowever, with the world evolving at pace and becoming ever more competitive, it is crucial that the UK keeps pushing hard to establish more effective trading opportunities for business.\n\n## Europe\nThe \u2018Partnership Council\u2019, was established to oversee UK-EU trade relations in the aftermath of Brexit.

It accounts for \u00a3126 billion \u2013 or over 20 per cent \u2013 of UK exports.\n\nOur family holds a number of investments in the US, including a recent investment in the rapidly expanding Go Car Wash. It is an attractive market in which to do business, and yet the prospects for a Free Trade Agreement with the US are remote at present.

Some time ago I found a group at Reddit where from my boomer age group description is of worried young people looking for ways to help prevent an insurrection, who would or already aid law enforcement by providing information and are inherently united, though the Trump era trying to label them as terrorists more often had them communicating in encrypted mode.  They have the WW2 nostalgic name of /IronFrontUSA and my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IronFrontUSA/comments/11wus46/npr_is_trump_actually_getting_arrested_this_week/) there was this one about the date coming from Trump (then apparently Fox to lawyers). Earlier news made it seem it was court set. I then reposted (with expanded title) here all here know too.\n\nI there had fun helping to brainstorm anti-propaganda tactics for what might be expected ahead, where no counter protest is from what I can see helpful or necessary, can help the opposition on their own splendidly fail, again. I did not plan it that way but in my opinion law enforcement monitoring social media will like the way we made right-wing muddlers who monitor for news of their enemy's actions and are thinking of rushing to his aid think twice before leaving home. Too many ways for all to go wrong. And the days of \"President Trump\" trying to use law enforcement to label even Democrats as a \"terrorist organization\" really are over, and their worse nightmare is back. Like in WW2 US again: when decoy tanks and planes are needed then Iron Front USA type groups would most likely immediately be constructing some in their nearest field. They may not overly trust any authority, and have an attention getting name, but united we stand all the same.\n\nExplaining all this at /Democrats is to strengthen our communication. Including law enforcement monitoring social media, who can for all I know post their hypothesis we didn't think of yet, to see what ANTIFA minded come up with. Where something was an inherently bad idea because of something not thought of it helps all to know, not law enforcement against them trying to label them as terrorists just for being there, because a President Trump said so.

It's fairly obvious that the unionist political parties who supported Brexit did so *because* they knew it would destabilize the political situation in Northern Ireland. Radical sectarian parties have no incentive to find solutions or support a government that they do not dominate because they profit politically from strife and division. The same was, to an extend, true for the UK Conservative party which is why there was a series of alliances of convenience between the two. Once the latter need an agreement or understanding with the EU, they invariably throw their Northern Irish \"allies\" under a bus.\n\nThey complain about the intransigence of NI politicians now, but that isn't even the problem. As has been seen, they have no problem ignoring regional governments to push heir policies through. They ignored the Scottish government throughout the Brexit process. They voted for the Withdrawal Agreement regardless of the opposition in NI. They agreed to this agreement too. The problem is not NI politicians complaining or stalling, but the radicals in their own party who use it to attack any agreement with the EU to boost their own careers. That is why they stall(ed). They don't care about unionism or Northern Ireland. They're afraid about the reaction of the tabloid press and its effect on the English voters on whom they depend. They're afraid of their own ambitious and equally unscrupulous colleagues outflanking them. Hence why the deal was possible now and not then: Brexit and anti-EU rhetoric is rapidly losing its purchase on the electorate, to the point where it is no longer an effective tool to further your own political position. Hence, the NI sea border loses its use as a wedge issue to force confrontation and gain attention outside NI itself.\n\nAs that trend continues, opponents to the agreement in NI will become ever more irrelevant. They only really had any influence because they were a pawn in the political games between the various factions within the Conservative party. Now that the players are moving on to other games (anti-immigration rhetoric mostly), they'll  lose even that and become an unwelcome distraction to their erstwhile allies.

The Tories had broken through the \u201cred wall\u201d. They seemed all-powerful. It was Labour that faced existential questions.\n\nNow, with about two years to go until the probable date of the next election and with Johnson and his successor, Liz Truss, both ousted by their own MPs, Labour is between 15 and 20 percentage points ahead in the polls at the end of 2022.\n\nThe NHS is on its knees and beset by strikes. It is desperately short of money and staff, with nurses, doctors and paramedics leaving in their thousands. Not a penny of the \u00a3350m a week that Johnson said Brexit would release for the health service has ever been seen. Increasingly, the whole Brexit endeavour is viewed by business leaders and economists as a self-inflicted disaster that has severely weakened the British economy, despite continued claims to the contrary by former Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg on the BBC\u2019s Question Time last week.\n\nFor Brexiters who followed Johnson, it was not supposed to be like this. He had promised them a new dawn of independence, deregulation, prosperity based on global trade deals and lower taxes. Instead, the reality is one of diminishing UK influence, dud trade deals or none at all (notably with the US), extra bureaucracy, reduced exports, lower gross domestic product and higher taxes.\n\nBrexit and the fear of a Jeremy Corbyn government helped power the Tories to an 80-seat majority. But disgruntled Brexit supporters are crying betrayal. They make the case that Brexit has been catastrophically mishandled and needs new management. Worryingly for Tory MPs, that is precisely what is being offered by Reform UK, the latest incarnation of the Brexit party, which stands at 8% in Sunday\u2019s Opinium poll for the Observer \u2013 1 point behind the Liberal Democrats and rising.\n\nBefore the party is even particularly well known, 19% of all voters questioned by Opinium said they would consider voting for Reform UK and its populist agenda on immigration, doing Brexit properly and lowering taxes, including 23% of 2019 Conservative voters and 11% of 2019 Labour voters.\n\nOne such convert is businessman David White from Barnsley. Until a few days ago he was a Tory councillor in the South Yorkshire town, but then defected and joined Reform UK. He is one of 9,000 nationally whom the party\u2019s leader, Richard Tice, says have signed up over the last two months.\n\nReform UK has a broad range of policies beyond doing Brexit better, such as offering a pay rise to nurses by exempting them from the basic rate of income tax for three years.\n\n\u201cWhen I announced the switch to Reform, I looked at my Facebook page with a little bit of trepidation,\u201d says White. \u201cI was expecting a bit of stick, but I had massive support, even from core Conservatives. Even the trolls that normally have a go didn\u2019t say anything. I think people suddenly realised that Reform is the real threat in the next elections.\u201d\n\nHe puts immigration top of his list. \u201cImmigration is one of the main issues from Brexit that people just don\u2019t feel has been sorted out at all. It\u2019s off the scale. There\u2019s a hotel down the road that\u2019s full. I got some video sent to me the other night of immigrants in this hotel outside playing football at midnight with the floodlights on and drinking coffee, and that just rankles with people.\u201d\n\nThroughout this part of South Yorkshire, as across much of the red wall, there is disillusion with Labour as well as the Tories. Lynne Dunning has lived nearby in the former mining village of Goldthorpe, eight miles from Barnsley, for 47 years.\n\n\u201cPeople feel abandoned by both parties,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I voted for Brexit, but what we\u2019ve got isn\u2019t what people voted for. It doesn\u2019t seem to have happened as it was promised. I think a lot of people feel like that.\u201d", "author": "trololo909"}, "j0p6zbg": {"child": ["j0p72sq"], "is_root": 0, "body": "Part 2 of 3\n\nIt is very early days for Tice\u2019s party \u2013 but Dunning\u2019s disillusion is exactly the kind of sentiment he is seeking to tap into.

This way, he hopes to defuse the fear among Tories that voting for an insurgent party such as his might let in a leftwing Labour government.\n\n\u201cThey are both variants of socialism,\u201d says Tice. \u201cYou have got the Consocialists and then there are the red socialists. There is no difference.\u201d He says the Tories have betrayed Brexit and that he wants to destroy them. \u201cI want the Tories out. I want them destroyed. I think they have ruined our economy. Don\u2019t underestimate us. They have deeply, deeply damaged this country. I am 58. The country has never been in a worse state.\u201d\n\nTory MPs and commentators insist they are not panicking about Reform UK \u2013 not yet, at least. Charles Walker, the MP for Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, says: \u201cThey are not yet a problem but if they are around at the general election and we have not sorted our problems out [inflation, the economy, small boats] then they will be.\u201d\n\nPaul Goodman, the former Tory MP who now edits the ConservativeHome website, says the real worry was former party leader Nigel Farage returning to front up Reform UK. \u201cMy sense is that most Conservative MPs are not frightened of Richard Tice but would be frightened of Farage.\u201d\n\nAnother, serving Conservative MP in a northern seat with many Brexit voters agrees. He says: \u201cI don\u2019t see them as a huge problem right now but if Farage came along to lead them, it would be different.\u201d The MP, who wishes to remain anonymous, adds: \u201cKeep my name out of it. I don\u2019t them want to target me.\u201d\n\nFor Tories less preoccupied with Brexit but concerned about what they see as their party\u2019s broader centrist drift, Reform UK is also proving attractive, with its deliberately wide policy offerings.\n\nKabeer Kher, a mortgage adviser who lives in Norfolk, joined the Conservatives in 2015 and remained a member until a few months ago, when he was tipped over the edge into joining Reform UK. \u201cFor me, the Conservatives have just become blue Labour now,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how they can have the policies they have, and still call themselves the Conservative party \u2013 they\u2019ve just abandoned their principles.\u201d\n\nHe complains about green policies, tax and housing. \u201cThe net-zero goals they\u2019ve set for reducing emissions have not been accompanied by any thought about where we were going to get the electricity power generation to actually facilitate that.\n\n\u201cTaxes on landlords have absolutely gone through the roof.

The Reform party is now the only party that doesn\u2019t subscribe to the green agenda and the speed with which they\u2019re doing it.\u201d\n\nAmong the Tory grassroots, who did not get a chance to vote for Truss\u2019s successor and feel they had Rishi Sunak foisted upon them, there are concerns that under the new prime minister they are becoming the party of high taxes and a big state.

It also seems to have remained more or less stable since 2016. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_net_migration_rate).\n\nThis suggests that immigration is not something that can be \"solved\", especially if you're not making a distinction between immigrants and refugees.\n\n> There\u2019s a hotel down the road that\u2019s full.\n\nThat settles it then.

All facetiousness aside, in my personal opinion Mr. White just comes across as a nasty person making up reasons to vote for a nasty and extremist political party. The fact that they all seem to think that the Conservative party has moved to the left (?) and is in some way \"socialist\" speaks volumes about their own political position and outlook. They can't admit to themselves or to others that they are economic radicals and social reactionaries, so they have to drag their political frame of reference with them to the right. This then has the effect of sundering their political reality (and vocabulary) from everyone else's.\n\nIn general, it seems the UK's Conservative party is back where it was in 2016. They're once again threatened by a split of the right wing vote. They can't run on their actual socioeconomic policies because these are (rightly) seen as ruinous and destructive to the interests of most people. Brexit as a distraction has run its course. So what will they do now, I wonder? The most probable course is that they'll move even further towards extremist positions. They'll go all in on the anti-immigration rhetoric and move further towards the far right in general. They'll focus on nativist nationalism and social reaction to cover up the laissez faire economics that are their actual agenda as well as the corruption and abuse of power that has become their method.\n\nThe big question is now: will it work?

There are centre-right politicians, but we don\u2019t think we\u2019re being led by Conservatives.

They don't really have a coherent ideological narrative any more, let alone one that they can convince enough people to follow. Creating a patchwork coalition of many angry groups is just about all they have left.

The law is more broad than the Freedom of Information Act and, crucially, a 2015 court ruling expanded its reach to cover private water companies.\n\nIt is currently being reviewed, alongside nearly two-thousand other pieces of European legislation, by officials at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).\n\nUnder the upcoming Retained EU Law (Reul) Bill, any European law not explicitly marked for retention will be abolished by default at the end of this year. Defra accounts for nearly half of all the laws being reviewed.\n\nWithout the EIR, campaigners are at risk of losing their supply to water company data, much of which is not held by the Environment Agency.\n\nPenelope Gane, head of practice at Fish Legal which was behind the 2015 case, told i: There\u2019s a gap\u2026 we know the Environment Agency are not asking for the data, so if [the EIR] is gone then we\u2019re back to being frustrated having to just rely on the regulator.\u201d\n\nThe EIR has been used by multiple NGOs to scrutinise water companies and the regulators.\n\nWindrush Against Sewage Pollution (Wasp) and Prof Peter Hammond have made extensive use of data acquired through the EIR to reveal the extent to which sewage is being illegally discharged by water companies.\n\n\u201cWithout the EIR the public would be in complete ignorance about the massive extent of illegal pollution and would just be fed the broad data, said Ashley Smith, Wasps founder.\n\n\u201cWe can see why some water companies would be desperate to get rid of them and the same applies to the regulators and government \u2013 all of which have been exposed as incompetent or complicit and various aspects of the sewage scandal.\u201d\n\nWater UK, the industry body, has been critical of Reul and publicly stated that the \u201cwater industry opposes any weakening of the laws on rivers and seas.\u201d\n\nNick Measham, chief executive of WildFish, another NGO, told i that disclosures under the EIR had been essential to the group\u2019s work.\n\nJim McMahon, the Shadow Environment Secretary, told i: \u201cThat the Tories are more concerned with hiding their damage rather than fixing it, shows that we have a government that has run out of road and nowhere to go.\u201d\n\nHe has pledged that a Labour government would \u201cend the Tory sewage scandal by delivering mandatory monitoring on all sewage outlets, introducing automatic fines for discharges, setting ambitious targets for reducing sewage dumping and ensuring that water bosses are held to account for negligent behaviour.\u201d\n\nMr McMahon\u2019s criticism was put to Defra.\n\nThe EIR came into force in 2005, at the same time as the Freedom of Information Act, and was required under European law to bring the UK into line with commitments made under the Aarhus Convention.\n\nThe UK remains a signatory to the Aarhus Convention, which commits member states to public access to environmental information. Members of the public could report the UK to the conventions compliance committee, but it is only capable of making non-binding recommendations.\n\nDefra ministers have insisted that EU laws will be retained by default unless there is a good reason to either repeal or reform it, but they have refused to commit to keeping the EIR or a number of other pieces of legislation that underpin the environmental protection of Britain\u2019s rivers.\n\nThose laws, such as the Water Framework Directive, have allowed campaigners to sue the Government into acting on river pollution.\n\nA Defra spokesperson told i: \u201cWe are unequivocal that reviewing our retained EU law will not come at the expense of the UK\u2019s already high standards.\n\n\u201cAs with all retained EU law, the accessibility of environmental information is being carefully considered.\u201d\n\nMr Misham was unimpressed by ministers\u2019 inability to offer certainty. \u201cYou\u2019d think they could just say simply, \u2018look, we\u2019re retaining it\u2019. [The EIR] has never been more important than it is now in terms of ability to scrutinise water companies,\u201d he said.\n\n## Save Britain\u2019s Rivers campaign\n\ni and its sister title New Scientist, the world\u2019s leading science magazine, have launched a joint campaign to force ministers and water companies to address the scandal of Britain\u2019s polluted waterways.\n\nOver the next year we will deliver hard-hitting reporting that shines a light on the crisis, including in-depth investigations, features, podcasts and live events.\n\nThe Save Our Rivers campaign has three aims:\n1. Reveal what\u2019s going on in the UK\u2019s rivers \u2013 and why.\n2. Raise awareness and understanding of the plight of our rivers \u2013 and the terrible effects of pollution on people and nature.\n3. Policy change. We will draw up a manifesto for our rivers \u2013 a robust, cross-party plan on how to fix them.\n\nWe will be speaking to experts and policymakers, business leaders and public officials. We also want to hear from you, i readers, to tell the stories of your local rivers and streams.\n\nEmail the newsdesk on stories@inews.co.uk.", "author": "trololo909"}, "jcaztdj": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "The distinctive smell of sovereignty", "author": "michalzxc"}, "jcax190": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "Conceal?

London should reconsider.\n\n_by Rebecca Mackinnon and Phil Bradley-Schmieg_\n\nThe UK\u2019s proposed Online Safety Bill would require platforms to screen and monitor all activity and content when uploaded to predict whether it is illegal or harmful. Such a general monitoring obligation is prohibited in the European Union\u2019s Digital Services Act.\n\nGovernments worldwide are drafting legislation and approving bills to address online safety challenges and hold technology platforms accountable for harmful content. This is good. But the UK is poised to play a leading role among Western democracies in imposing such broad monitoring that could chill free expression.     \n\nHere\u2019s how: the proposed UK law imposes new duties to \u201cprevent\u201d access to a wide variety of poorly defined content categories. For everyone under 18, a prohibition would be imposed on displaying content that the UK Parliament does not even view as illegal. Such blacklisting requires accurately predicting not just every reader\u2019s location and age, but also whether rapidly modified or uploaded content matches a dizzying range of criteria across dozens of other UK laws (mostly criminal statutes).  This poses an impossible challenge for platforms.     \n\nFacing huge fines and \u201csuper-complaints\u201d if they underblock, platforms will be forced to take a conservative approach \u2013 taking down legal material and excluding legitimate but hard-to-profile visitors.\n\nFor non-commercial, public interest platforms such as Wikipedia, the UK bill threatens to undermine their volunteer-driven governance model. In contrast, Europe\u2019s DSA explicitly recognizes the difference between centralized content moderation carried out by employees, and community-governed content moderation systems.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: the Wikimedia Foundation, which hosts Wikipedia and other volunteer-run free knowledge projects, supports efforts to make the Internet safe. When people are harassed or feel otherwise unsafe communicating online, their ability to access, create or share knowledge is diminished. But Wikimedia believes online safety can only be achieved when adequate safeguards are in place for privacy and freedom of expression.\n\nA key issue is protecting children. Unlike commercial services, Wikipedia does not target people of any age with paid advertisements or profile them in order to amplify personalized content. But the UK proposal for mandatory age verification or assurance \u2014 \u201cage-gating\u201d \u2014 would force platforms including Wikipedia to know a reader\u2019s age, exposing both adults and children alike to new security and privacy risks.\n\nThe precedent is alarming. Even the best age assurance tools have been shown to be inaccurate.  If the UK forces us to collect such data about UK users, we can expect that many other governments around the world will impose similar requirements.\n\nFrom our perspective, the UK should explicitly recognize and support community-governed content moderation systems, which are effective against harmful speech and in protecting human rights. Obligations placed on nonprofit, public interest platforms with decentralized, volunteer-run content moderation models such as Wikipedia should be differentiated from those required for for-profit platforms, which have top-down, centrally directed content moderation supported by advertising-driven business models designed to maximize profit for shareholders.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Online Safety Bill presently lacks the strong safeguards and clear definitions necessary to ensure that it does not cause the removal of educational material, medical information \u2014 including documentation of the COVID-19 pandemic. This encourages over-blocking and could mean losing an accurate historical record as well as access to reliable information.\n\nWhat is and what is not considered \u201charmful\u201d, for instance to children, depends on an individual\u2019s point of view and preferences or, more worryingly, the views of the government. From 1988 to 2003, the UK outlawed teaching children about \u201cthe acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship\u201d. Marginalized voices in particular are at risk of being silenced by top-down removal and content suppression requirements for \u201charmful content.\u201d\n\nUK policymakers should make significant changes. They should narrow the scope of the proposed bill to carve out \u201charmful\u201d content.  The duties to predict and filter what is \u201ccontent that is harmful to children\u201d and \u201cillegal content\u201d should be tightly drawn.  Drafters should remove clauses related to criminal liability, and they must do more to preserve notice-and-takedown, not predictive top-down moderation, as the general foundation for online safety, just as the EU is doing. Any requirements around keeping internet users safe from harm should also protect end-to-end encrypted communications.\n\nSupporters of Brexit once argued that it would free the UK from European overregulation. Unfortunately, the Online Safety Bill in its present form threatens to produce the opposite outcome.     \n\n_Rebecca MacKinnon is Vice President, Global Advocacy and Phil Bradley-Schmieg is Lead Counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation._", "author": "trololo909"}, "j0qg0an": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "Won't happen, but lots of fun laughing at more red white and blue tape from Westminster! \ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udf7f", "author": "doctor_morris"}, "j0t0pnr": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "Conservatives are worried they are losing votes so they want to control every person's choice.", "author": "49orth"}, "j0rcydn": {"child": ["j0sn6nr"], "is_root": 0, "body": "This party doesn\u2019t like it when you tell the truth about it or Brexit.

At the time, support for Brexit was already faltering so the festival was presumably meant either as a morale booster or at the very least get a few positive headlines to distract from the continual failures at the negotiation table.\n\nHowever, at some point the organizers contracted to run the festival rejected the branding, because they feared it would depress visitor numbers. Presumably they did this because by that time (2020) Brexit had become quite toxic among the majority of the population and the actual Brexit festivities turned out as somewhat of a dud (to put it mildly). Therefore, they decided to rebrand it to \"Festival UK 2022\" as the original name had also been tainted by the connection with Brexit. In 2021, presumably in an attempt to distance themselves even further from the original context, they rebranded it again to \"Unboxed: Creativity in the UK\".\n\nBasically, it went from high profile and toxic to low profile and nobody cared.

Brexit supporters loathe the idea and demanded reassurance. Their new leader, whose pro-Brexit beliefs are being called into question, duly obliged.  \nThat\u2019s a pity. If Sunak and his ministers aren\u2019t indeed thinking about this, they should be. Brexit is a proven failure. Limiting the harm from this historic error should be their top priority.  \nBritain\u2019s economy is in worse trouble than most of the EU, with higher inflation, a looming recession, stressed public services, rising taxes and dismal productivity growth. Although Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine is driving the recession, slumping trade, weak investment and labor shortages all implicate Brexit. A former Bank of England policymaker recently told Bloomberg it has \u201cpermanently damaged\u201d the economy. The public is increasingly of the same view.  \nBritain now has a stripped-down free-trade agreement with the EU. That means no tariffs or quotas. But border controls are still required as long as the UK remains outside the single market. This is threatening the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland, one of Sunak\u2019s most immediate tests, while making things harder for companies large and small that were accustomed to trading with Europe as easily as they trade within the UK.  \nIdeally, you might think, Britain would just correct its mistake and apply to rejoin. Sadly, that won\u2019t be possible for years, if ever. Even if the UK could bring itself to ask, many EU members would refuse, regarding the Brits (with reason) as too much trouble. Simply duplicating Switzerland\u2019s arrangement also won\u2019t fly, because that precise model has drawbacks for both sides. Yet the principle of a halfway or associate membership of the EU \u2014 a closer economic partnership than the current wreck of UK-EU relations \u2014 can and should be explored.  \nFull membership of Europe\u2019s single market requires complete alignment with EU laws affecting trade and many other policy areas. Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are members of the single market even though they aren\u2019t members of the EU: They apply EU rules and directives without any real say in devising them. The Swiss model is more respectful of the sovereignty that the UK wants to preserve. It\u2019s based on a basic free-trade pact plus a raft of bilateral sectoral agreements aimed at harmonizing regulations, reducing frictions at the border and (partially) recognizing the EU\u2019s \u201cfour freedoms\u201d of goods, services, capital and people.  \nIn one crucial way, this approach works well: Switzerland has a high degree of economic integration with the EU. Yet tending to this legal order consumes enormous time and effort. The EU doesn\u2019t like it and is pushing a comprehensive \u201cframework agreement\u201d that would most likely diminish Swiss bargaining power. The current model might be even less to the EU\u2019s liking if applied to the UK, which is bigger and, if history is any guide, more inclined to be awkward.  \nEven so, partial or associate membership of the single market would repair Brexit\u2019s biggest defects. A streamlined version of the Swiss model, balancing economic integration and constitutional separation, could suit both Europe and the UK \u2014 and other potential partners as well.

Ministers\u2019 failure to grip Brexit planning and put in place practical solutions has cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds.\n\n\u201cTaking sensible steps, such as negotiating a veterinary agreement, as Labour has called for, could have reduced cost and unnecessary trade barriers.\u201d\n\nWhen Jacob Rees-Mogg, the then-Brexit opportunities minister, scrapped plans for full checks last year, he admitted that pressing ahead would have meant higher supermarket prices and a \u00a31bn annual bill for traders.\n\nFears were also raised that EU suppliers would choose to shun the UK altogether because of growing Brexit red tape, leading to foods disappearing from shops and further price hikes.\n\nBut critics have also highlighted the consequences of waiving checks \u2013 because Brexit shut the UK out of the EU\u2019s pest and disease notification systems, forcing it to rely on other sources for alerts.\n\nThe British Veterinary Association warned the UK is opening the door to diseases including African Swine Fever and that inaction would \u201cwreak havoc\u201d on prevention systems.\n\nUK firms have also been left at a competitive disadvantage, because their EU rivals can send goods to the UK without the costly bureaucracy confronting exporters to the single market.\n\nThe \u00a3466m bill for the IBFs comes on top of \u00a3200m allocated to ports to develop their own control points, only for them to be left with costs they can no longer recoup from charging for inspections.\n\nPortsmouth spent \u00a36m of council taxpayers\u2019 money on its hi-tech border facility, with the Government contributing \u00a317m \u2013 and now faces a further \u00a34m bill for refitting an empty building.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complete mess,\u201d said Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the city council\u2019s Liberal Democrat leader, adding: \u201cWe checked with the Government through all the planning stages and built it exactly as they asked.\n\n\u201cNow the Government have said this facility won\u2019t be needed, so we have to find another \u00a34m to rip out all of the equipment, another waste of public money.\u201d\n\nA Government spokesperson defended its approach, saying: \u201cInland Border Facilities are constantly under review to make sure they provide value for the taxpayer and meet the demands of traffic flow.\n\n\u201cThe UK Government is developing a seamless, digital border that will improve security and biosecurity while reducing friction and costs for businesses.\n\n\u201cWe will shortly set out our plans for introducing biosecurity controls, and the remaining Inland Border Facilities will play a crucial role in delivering that policy.\u201d", "author": "trololo909"}, "jd855hb": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "'Checks on food imports from the EU 'would have been an act of self-harm', says Jacob Rees Mogg after the UK delayed plans to impose the checks until the end of 2023.'\n\n[act of self-harm](https://twitter.com/ITVNewsPolitics/status/1519691770736558081?s=20)", "author": "gerrymandering_jack"}, "jd7yccc": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "For many importers, Brexit hasn\u2019t happened yet.", "author": "doctor_morris"}, "jd7t7sf": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "Meanwhile the UK Action Fraud organization sit idly by on all things Brexit.", "author": "istillknownowt"}, "jd8ovqe": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "I wonder which Tory donor got fast tracked into this dodgy contract.", "author": "Worfs-forehead"}, "jd9kaxf": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "You people vote them in twice!  \n\n\nCongrats!", "author": "K9US"}, "jd9l854": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "Not to worry, we are getting back like \u00a3350 million a week from leaving the EU.", "author": "Seahawk124"}, "jd7otj0": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "Tsk, people knew what they were voting for!\n\nIt's patronising to suggest that voters didn't want a bunch of expensive food inspection sites to lay idle for years.

There's no outrage, no protest, no demands, nothing.  It's a done topic for them.  If anything, the Brexit topic for them doesn't exist anymore and they don't truly have an incentive to change the path of the UK because they didn't lose the EU.\n\nYou're talking about changing the minds of the youths that couldn't care less or will stick with Brexit only because they are conservatives and that's what the Tories represent.  The fact is that the UK needs to stop divergence, first thing, and begin convergence with the EU again on structures and schemes.  This needs to go on for years and sustainably.  The political system needs to be stabilized and until there's a new one that is resistant to tampering and fraud, there won't be a chance.  In short, the UK's democracy and democratic structure needs to be overhauled and fortified.  Unfortunately, decades of arrogance, britishness, and neglect of educational systems have made for a hopeless situation and there's no way the EU wants the UK back and we're all cringing here reading these lines where people in the UK think it's just a matter of snapping your fingers and the EU will race to take you back.  These wishes are always one-sided and exist in the vacuum of britishness and british exceptionalism and entitlement.  The UK and everyone in are are anti-democratic, even if you claim you are, you have no clue what democracy is, you have no will or inclination to fix your democracy and reinforce it.  You don't even know what being an EU member entails outside of taking the fast lane at airports and retiring elsewhere.  Now that the UK is in a major decline it has absolutely no chance of recovering from, why would the EU want to take on another leper colony?\n\nLastly, just look at the Ukrainians who are dying because they wanted to the join the EU.  We're seeing what it looks like for people who want to be European and want to be an example of it.  So much so, that during the war, Ukraine is tackling the corruption issues and handling transparency and opening these books to the alliance.  The UK is not even close to this.  We're all meeting Ukranians in Europe and really understanding that they are not different from us and understand our ways of life and we understand theirs.  The UK is a place that simply doesn't care to understand us, feels it doesn't need to, and feels it's above us.", "author": "RidetheSchlange"}, "jdv7fyb": {"child": ["jdvcrwu"], "is_root": 0, "body": "It's actually not true.  You're not reading the room like pretty much everyone from the UK.  \n\n\nBarnier worked for years, at war often times, to negotiate Brexit while the UK was being combative.  He would not be in charge of Article 49, has no say in it, nothing.  He's speaking on theory, not on fact.  The theory that's contained there was already addressed by me that the UK needs to take steps in hard terms of convergence with the EU to even start.  Of course, you didn't read any of that.   I already stated the EU will need to see convergence and concrete steps for the objective requirements.  This includes reinstating freedom of movement, single market, and other schemes and it's almost certain that there will will be a demand to change to the Euro and not a timeline that can be extended indefinitely, but actual results.  \n\n\nThen there is the subjective aspect and that will be a wildcard and unfortunately, the UK is still filled with looneys and russian operatives in government, as well as right-radicals with significant sway in the middle of society and not in the fringes.  The EU is also discussing in conferences not being completely convinced by Labour, either, especially since Starmer has made the official position of the party to not be remain.  So the two major parties do not believe in the EU, nor do their followers or the ideologues sitting at the top.  \n\n\nAnyhow, Barnier saying the UK can come back is being interpreted by you with british exceptionalism.  To return, the UK has to fulfill Article 49 requirements, as well as subjective requirements and there's no way the ambassadors of the EU27 who have their positions to read the mentality of the people of the UK will say this is a good idea.  The UK simply isn't there and we're so far off.  You think Barnier saying the UK can come back is a snap of the finger issue when it's going to entail years of reintegration.  How do you think that will happen dealing with parties like the Tories and their ERG, the DUP, and others?  \n\n\nThis is from 2020:\n\n[https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2020/01/23/membership-2-0-what-the-uk-rejoining-the-eu-would-involve/](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2020/01/23/membership-2-0-what-the-uk-rejoining-the-eu-would-involve/)  \n\n\nThis is 2023 from a pro-EU think tank:  \n[https://ukandeu.ac.uk/five-reasons-why-rejoining-the-eu-is-a-difficult-path-to-follow/](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/five-reasons-why-rejoining-the-eu-is-a-difficult-path-to-follow/)  \n\n\nConcise:  \n[https://www.eurointelligence.com/column/can-the-uk-rejoin-the-eu](https://www.eurointelligence.com/column/can-the-uk-rejoin-the-eu)  \n\n\nThis also reflects a bit on the Barnier statement and is concise, but these aren't all the parameters.

I would say it's unfair to say an entire nation are like those English dominated towns on the Costa del Sol or Northern Paris which look and feel identical to England simply because those living there don't appreciate those countries (and therefore integrate) for anything but the sun. I integrated well with the Spanish by having had a great level of Spanish due to talking everyday with a Spanish boyfriend for 3 years, and integrated with the other European international studies simply because of how fantastic their commitment was to learning English... It's a matter of effort, not nationality that determines the behaviour of those who never decide to really become native.\n\nAs for the young people who aren't protesting for reentry to the EU. Unfortunately, the media here will not speak about what we've lost due to leaving. Everything is blamed on the pandemic and neither political party will touch the subject. So the English don't have any peaceful way of communicating that they want the EU back. Furthermore, the 2019 election was not simply voted on the lines of labour will offer an opportunity back into the EU, there was a massive smear campaign against the labour party leader by the media owned by the conservative donors using the tax haven islands about to be taken from them by EU law. I remember the excitement for Corbyn by all the young people but unfortunately the older people I know have told me they would never vote labour due to the actions of a labour party 40 years ago...\n\nAs for non-peaceful riots, I'm afraid I have no idea for why there are none of these against the government who are (or have) made protest illegal on the grounds that it may inconvenience other people. I stayed with a French friend last month where we attended a protest where I was in awe to witness the national alliance for older people that deserve to retire at 62.\n\nI absolutely agree that if the UK would like any chance of being re-accepted, they need to start converging everything they can and ASAP.

The National Audit Office (NAO) has said \u00a3120 million was \u201cfrittered away\u201d.\n\nProjects supported by the festival included a virtual reality experience in which visitors pretend to be a transgender parent adopting a gender-fluid toddler, and an employment scheme called Tour de Moon that gave money to nightclub workers staging events in abandoned discotheques.\n\nOther projects included turning an old oil rig in Weston-super-Mare into an art installation and a three-day music festival in Glasgow that taught people how to grow vegetables.\n\nIts origins date to a speech by Theresa May to the Conservative Party conference in 2018. She promised to organise a carnival of \u201cBritish creativity and innovation, culture and heritage\u201d that would be inspired by the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the Festival of Britain in 1951.\n\nAfter a campaign by Jacob Rees-Mogg for a public celebration to mark Britain\u2019s departure from the EU, the event became popularly known as the \u201cFestival of Brexit\u201d .\n\nTo broaden its appeal, however, the man appointed to oversee the festival tried to depoliticise its agenda and it was renamed \u201cUnboxed: Creativity in the UK\u201d.\n\nMartin Green, head of ceremonies for the London Olympics, said the festival would struggle to attract visitors if it were seen as overtly political and that it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d the festival had become associated with Brexit.\n\nAccording to House magazine, he sought assurances from ministers, saying: \u201cCan I ascertain it\u2019s not a Brexit festival? You don\u2019t want some kind of jingoistic jamboree?\u201d As a result of the efforts to minimise its association with Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU, some of the artists, performers and musicians who ended up producing work for Unboxed had no idea that it was originally associated with Brexit.\n\nGareth Davies, head of the NAO, announced an inquiry into the festival after MPs on the digital, culture, media and sport committee demanded one. Davies said it would examine whether \u201cpolitical pressures kept the project alive\u201d and if officials knew that the visitor estimates were unrealistic.\n\nJulian Knight, who chairs the committee, said: \u201cThat such an exorbitant amount of public cash has been spent on a so-called celebration of creativity that has barely failed to register in the public consciousness raises serious red flags about how the project has been managed from conception through to delivery.\u201d\n\nThe culture department said: \u201cWe do not agree with the select committee\u2019s views.\u201d", "author": "trololo909", "node_num": 7, "long_node_num": 5, "avg_len": 59.285714285714285}, "irv1knm": {"child": ["irvcorn", "irx63my"], "is_root": 0, "body": "Projects supported by the festival included a virtual reality experience in which visitors pretend to be a transgender parent adopting a gender-fluid toddler.\n\nWait, what?

Marjorie Taylor Greene's congressional account Tuesday after she repeatedly posted a graphic that referred to a \u201cTrans Day of Vengeance.\u201d\n\nAccording to a screenshot Greene, R-Ga., posted on her personal account, Twitter said it had \u201ctemporarily limited\u201d some of her account\u2019s features, with full functionality scheduled to be restored in seven days.\n\nThe post in question, which Twitter has since removed, included a graphic that Greene said was for an antifa event in Washington, D.C., next month.\n\n\u201cAntifa is organizing a Trans Day of Vengeance,\" Greene wrote in accompanying text.\n\nElla Irwin, Twitter's vice president of product overseeing trust and safety, said the company had conducted a \"sweep\" to remove more than 5,000 tweets and retweets of the graphic, including Greene's.\n\n\"We do not support tweets that incite violence irrespective of who posts them,\" Irwin tweeted. \"'Vengeance' does not imply peaceful protest. Organizing or support for peaceful protests is ok.\"\n\nAccording to Irwin, Twitter decided to restrict the graphic from being shared but with \u201cno impact to users for having tweeted it\u201d unless it was \u201creposted after removal or was posted with additional calls for violence/ wishes of harm.\u201d\n\nGreene\u2019s office shared a copy of the deleted post and Twitter\u2019s communication with her but did not respond to a request for additional comment. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening.\n\nIrwin said \"a high number of users\" reported the graphic Monday, most likely \"due to heightened sensitivity to the language, given the tragic events in Nashville,\" where six people, including three children, were gunned down at a Christian elementary school.\n\nNashville police said the shooter was Audrey Hale, whom they identified as a transgender former student of The Covenant School. Hale, 28, was killed by police.\n\nIn the wake of the shooting, some GOP lawmakers have focused on the suspect\u2019s gender identity amid an intensifying battle waged by some conservatives against transgender people.\n\nGreene has been a vocal critic of transgender rights on Capitol Hill. During her first year in Congress, she placed a sign outside her office mocking a Democratic lawmaker whose daughter is transgender after the Democrat hung a transgender pride flag next to her door. The same year, Greene co-sponsored legislation to ban U.S. embassies from flying the LGBTQ pride flag. Last year, she supported a proposal to ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors; she said this month she planned to reintroduce the measure.\n\nGreene\u2019s Twitter restriction is not the first time she has run afoul of the site's policies. Last year, her personal account was suspended for repeatedly violating Twitter's Covid misinformation policy. Twitter also flagged a tweet on her congressional account that mocked a transgender Biden administration official, saying the post violated the company\u2019s rules for hateful conduct.\n\nGreene was also repeatedly suspended in 2021 for false claims about election fraud in Georgia and for her tweets about vaccines.\u201d\n\nXxxx\n\n\n\nJesus Christ it must be VERY VERY BAD for Elon\u2019s Twitter to actually restrict conservative hate tweets.

It's only an ideological gamble if you assume they are acting in good faith, i.e. if they actually believe that people in general will be better off from these policies.

They will implement these policies in the middle of an inflationary spiral in order to transfer more assets and wealth into the hands of those at the top and they don't care about the effect this has on normal people or on the social system upon which the latter depend. If the state and the associated social services collapses under the debt they created, so be it. It will simply be another opportunity to advocate for \"cutting it down to size\". They have no incentive to govern well, because their entire point is that government does not work and should retreat from economic and social policy areas.\n\nIn this reasoning, their gamble is not so much ideological as it is pragmatic and cynical: they have looked at the past years and concluded that they can distract enough of the electorate with wedge issues to fairly consistently win a plurality of the vote (which is enough in the UK's system) while still pushing for socioeconomic policies that are harmful for the vast majority of the population. They may be wrong in this gamble or they may be right, and not everyone in their party may be so sure about it working, but in the end they have been going strong for years and they have at least two more to go. It is probably hybris to expect no consequences for this (political or economic), but then realism or pragmatism has never really been their thing anyway and their wealth and position will always protect them from the consequences regardless of what happens.\n\nIn short: The gamble is not ideological, \"will it work?\", but cynical and self serving: \"can we get away with it?\".", "author": "barryvm"}, "ippc2yo": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "Exactly, well said.", "author": "ltron2"}, "ipn6tf7": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": ">UK\u2019s Biggest Tax Cuts Since 1972 Trigger Crash in Pound, Bonds\n\nThe Scum newspaper?

In the global economy, companies will simply choose to transfer jobs and invest elsewhere,\" he warned.\n\nThe high-profile businessman's comments come after the government announced in the autumn \u00a325bn worth of tax rises in an attempt to balance the books and restore credibility to the UK's finances after the economic fallout of the Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget.\n\nOne of the many mini-budget polices reversed was changes to corporation tax, which is paid to the government by UK companies and foreign companies with UK offices. It is set to rise from 19% to 25% in April.\n\nUK businesses, as well as households, are also dealing with the highest rate of inflation for four decades, with energy bills driving price rises through supply chains.\n\nIn his comment piece, Sir James repeated his concern over working-from-home policies following the height of the Covid pandemic.\n\nHe said the government had \"yet to direct\" workers to return to workplaces after \"ordering them to stay at home\".\n\n\"This has badly damaged the country's work ethic,\" he said.\n\nHe argued \"no weight\" had been afforded to the \"importance of face-to-face collaboration, shared culture, mental health, productivity and output, or the training of new and young employees\", which he said was \"fundamental to the success of businesses and employees alike\".\n\nBut the entrepreneur wrote that the UK could \"shake off its Covid inertia\" and \"turn things around, but only if fast-growing companies are allowed to thrive here\".\n\nHe said the government had a \"role to play\", which started with the spring Budget in March.\n\n\"It must incentivise private innovation and demonstrate its ambition for growth,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Mr Gove rejected Sir James' view that the country needed to \"shake off its Covid inertia\", saying the government was committed to reducing inflation and growing the economy.\n\n\"If we are being accused of inertia I think it's important that we stress the energy at which we are pursing smarter regulation in a variety different ways that will help enterprise,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\n\n## Britishvolt collapse 'disappointing'\nThe UK electric vehicle industry was dealt a blow earlier this week when battery start-up Britishvolt collapsed into administration, with the majority of its 232 staff made redundant.\n\nThe firm had planned to build a giant factory to make electric car batteries in Blyth, Northumberland, and ministers had hailed it as a \"levelling up\" opportunity that would boost the region's economy and support the future of UK car making.\n\nSir John Armitt, chair of the National Infrastructure Commission, which advises the government, told the BBC it was \"very disappointing\" the company was unable to secure funding keep it afloat, but said he was hopeful the plant could be \"resurrected\".\n\nMr Gove said the government knew the site where Britishvolt had planned to build its battery factory was \"hugely valuable, hugely attractive\".\n\n\"We do know the approach we are taking towards electric vehicles will mean there will be more investment of this kind in the future,\" he added.\n\nAsked about Sir James' comments, Sir John said investment in the UK was \"probably declining\" in part because of the concern over regulatory changes with the EU following Brexit.\n\n\"Personally, I think we should as far as possible continue to comply with EU regs because that makes it easier for companies to compete in Europe,\" he added.\n\nSir James had faced criticism previously when he announced he would relocate his firm's global head office to Singapore from Malmesbury in Wiltshire in 2019.\n\nIn 2021, he moved his residency back to the UK from Singapore.", "author": "trololo909"}, "j50bdgy": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "I boycott the minority of businesses  ..Dyson,  JML, Simsons, etc who were brexit supporters....", "author": "IndicationLazy4713"}, "j50znp8": {"child": [], "is_root": 0, "body": "Dyson was very Pro-Brexit - but he moved his company to Singapore I think.\n\nBrexit is a bad idea.

Prior to partygate, he was the only person who had enough charisma to sell this disaster as a success to fools who were desperate to listen. But you need charisma even to persuade fools, and Sunak doesn\u2019t have that, he\u2019s proven that he doesn\u2019t. \n\nI will concede that if there is a silver lining to Sunak\u2019s premiership, it is that he might actually be more competent than Boris or Truss at managing the fallout of this slow moving disaster. This competence may lead to *slightly* greater electoral success in two years than we would expect from looking at today\u2019s polls. You may ask (probably loudly): why on earth is this a positive thing?! I\u2019ll tell you why: it\u2019s because it increases the chances of a hung parliament, which is what Britain actually needs. Because that\u2019s the only way FPTP ends. \n\nThe FPTP system, albeit with the active complicity of Labour (who refused to ally with anyone, which is why I also call them dunces), helped cause this Brexit debacle. It provided the illusion that the majority of the electorate still supported a hard Brexit, when they did not. It gave a political party, with only a plurality of the electorate\u2019s support, a \u201cmandate\u201d to leave the EU *and* fuck up its relationship with it. And it did so despite a hard Brexit being against the will of the majority.

Ancillary costs (pension perks/vote bribes)  add another 11-13% - this alone is higher than what's paid in all other kinds of welfare benefits\n\nIn other words, the long term result of Brexit - which was primarily driven by neoliberal extremists seeking to preserve Britain as a safe haven for tax-dodging and money laundering - would be the forced elimination of all such practices.\n\n I believe they were trying to use the population as unwitting human shields against economic sanctions which the USA, EU and others are imposing on virtually all tax-haven jurisdictions in the wake of the Panama+Pandora revelations.

IIRC, in the fairy tale, the nakedness of the emperor is pointed out by a child, i.e. a personification of innocence. It is highly probable that the people who supported this mess throughout the referendum and two subsequent elections were not taken in, but knew very well what they were doing. They might not have known (or cared about) the exact consequences, but then they never wanted to learn about them either. The lies, and the liars were transparent but still enough people voted for them. They just imagined that the collateral damage inflicted would be worth it when they got whatever they wanted out of it. In other words, they were not deceived but *complicit* and as such will not now change sides.\n\n> When are we ready to admit failure as a nation? \n\nThere is no we. There is \"us and them\". And \"we\" can't admit failure if that means \"they\" win. The whole psychological setup of Brexit was such as to to merge political and personal, to ensure that there is no \"we\" and never will be where Brexit is concerned. Divide and rule.\n\n> If we use the polls, only 20% would vote for a party that wants to reverse Brexit. So it seems we still have 30% to go. I can't even imagine how much worse it has to get before people can finally admit the obvious.\n\nThe UK Labour party will present them with an easier way out. They will \"accept Brexit\", while also offering an alternative for the Conservative party which has made a mess of it all. Never mind that this means the economic and political damage of Brexit will endure, and that there will be no real solutions to the problems it has created. Even if a majority thinks Brexit has failed, then that does not mean the UK's two party system will give them what they want. All it will do is give them a reasonable alternative to today's nutjobs (presuming Labour's current poll lead holds). The only reason the Conservative party loses is that it will have made itself so hated that it mobilizes voters *against* them. To mobilize *for* something, either party has to offer it, which is not the case for Brexit. The only way out for the anti-Brexit voting block is to push for proportional representation, which would break this cycle.\n\n> But of course it will inevitably get worse if we continue on this trajectory.\n\nI  agree. Note that there is zero political backlash against any of this. Voters don't like it (for obvious reasons) but they don't matter for another two and a half years. The current set of Conservative MP's are as complicit as can be in this mess and will tacidly support this disaster just as they did the previous ones. They don't have enough time to install yet another leader. They definitely don't want an election. So they will at best denounce this in public while doing absolutely nothing to actually stop it (e.g. through a vote of no confidence). There is almost no scenario where it goes better from here, but they will still hope and pray for this to blow over and give them at least a shot at winning another election.
